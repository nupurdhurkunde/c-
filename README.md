This is a basic project that I made in my 1st semester. It can store and edit employee personal details, record and display attendance, and calculate next salary increment by taking today's date and employye's joining date.

The system also verfies employee by password during login process.

In the future, I plan to make the login process more secure by adding face recognisation or similar authentication method.
